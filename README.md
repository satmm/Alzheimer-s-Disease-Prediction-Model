## Features

The following features are used by the machine learning model for prediction:

- ASF (Feature 1)
- MR DELAY (Feature 2)
- GENDER (Feature 3)
- AGE (Feature 4)
- EDUC (Feature 5)
- SES (Feature 6)
- MMSE (Feature 7)
- CDR (Feature 8)
- eTIV (Feature 9)
- nWBV (Feature 10)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Alzheimer-Disease-Prediction-Model.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
 ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python your_flask_app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

3. Follow the instructions on the website to take the Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Test.

## Results

The prediction result will be displayed on the result page. If the result is DEMENTED, the label will be displayed in red, and if it's non-DEMENTED, it will be displayed in green.

## Tips

- **DEMENTED Result:**
  - Engage in Cognitive Activities : Stimulate the brain with puzzles, memory games, and reading to maintain cognitive function.
  - Establish Routine and Support System :
    1. Create a structured daily routine for a sense of security.
    2. Build a strong support system with family or caregivers for emotional well-being.

- **Non-DEMENTED Result:**
  - Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle : Adopt regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and sufficient sleep for overall well-being.
  - Stay Socially Active : Actively participate in social activities to maintain cognitive abilities and emotional health.
